# unvrs
A particle engine, I've always wanted to write.

## Setup

Install `unvrs` via `npm`:

    npm install unvrs --save-dev

The recommended way of consuming `unvrs` is by requiring only specific parts of the api:

    var merge = require('unvrs/functions/merge');

You can also require the whole package:

    var unvrs = require('unvrs');

Or just include it via a script tag:

    <script src="node_modules/dist/unvrs.js"></script>

## Code examples

Code examples are located inside `examples` directory. These feature some of the basic usages of the library.
